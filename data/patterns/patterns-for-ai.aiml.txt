 WHAT IS AIML
template The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence MarkupLanguage) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.Compared with other chat robot languages AIML is perhaps the simplest.Thematching language is very simple for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in s. AIML is an XML language implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel especially to people with HTML experience.An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the aiml and /aiml tags respectively.
