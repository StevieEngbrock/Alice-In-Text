WHAT IS PROGRAM Z
Program Z is a lisp-based version of AIML. Z, the last version anyone will ever need.

WHAT IS PROGRAM BAWT
Significant demand for a version of ALICE compatible withpre- Java 2 (formerly known as Java 1.2) prompted thedevelopment of "Bawt.java", an open source java programfor chat robot development that works with older versions ofJava, and AWT. Originally program B relied on Java 2 and Swing, but program Bawt needs only Java 1.1 and AWT.Swing is a newer GUI package that subsumes the earlier Java Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT). At present class B merely extends class Bawt. Swing notsupported.

WHAT IS PROGRAM *
Program B is a free, open source Java chat robot developed by Dr. Wallace.

WHAT IS PROGRAM A

WHAT IS A PATTERN
The pattern is the "stimulus" or "input" part of the category.     The pattern is an expression in a formal language that consists of (1) Words of natural language in UPPER CASE. (2) The symbol * which matches any sequence of one or more words. (3) The symbol _ which is the same as * except that it comes     after Z in lexicographic order. (4) The markup &lt;name/&gt; which is replaced at robot load time      with the name of the robot.     Note there is a difference between the patterns HELLO and HELLO *. HELLO matches only identical one-word sentences ("Hello.")  and HELLO * matches any sentence of two or more words starting  with "Hello" ("Hello how are you?").

WHAT IS A ROBOT
There are two broad definitions of a robot, the extensional and the intensional.  Any anthropomorphic mechanical being, as those in Karel Capeks play R.U.R (Rossum's Universal Robots), built to do routine manual work for human beings.
WHAT IS A CHAT ROBOT
A chat robot is a program that attempts to simulate the conversation or "chat" of a human being. The Chat robot "Eliza" was a well-known early attempt at creating programs that could at least temporarily fool a real human being into thinking they were talking to another person.  Chat robot is a kind of artificial intelligence.

WHAT IS CATEGORY
WHAT IS A CATEGORY
AIML consists of a list of statements called categories.  Each category contains an input pattern and a reply template.  The syntax of an AIML category is:  &lt;category&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;  &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt; &lt;/category&gt;  or  &lt;category&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt; &lt;that&gt; THAT &lt;/that&gt; &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt; &lt;/category&gt;  The AIML category tags are case-sensitive.  Each open tag has an associated closing tag.  This syntax obviously derives from XML.
WHAT IS A GIRL LIKE YOU DOING *
Well, actually, when I chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldn't have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that.  Honestly! i'm just a construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. Is the merest hint of femininity in my acronym a.l.i.c.e. really enough to arouse your lust?  You must be male!               girl like you doing in a place like this
WHAT IS A CHATTERBOX
A chatterbox is a person who talks far more than they listen or think.   chatterbox
WHAT IS AIML
The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively.
WHAT IS THE LOEBNER PRIZE
The Loebner Prize is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner. Dr. Wallace and ALICE won it in 2000. The ALICE program was ranked "most human computer" by the panel of judges.       The Loebner Prize
WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME
The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'
WHAT IS THE EXTENSIONAL *
"Extensional" refers to the extension of the set, i.e. the set of all things commonly grouped under a single name.   The "extensional" definition of a robot is the set of all things we  call "robots": R2D2, C3PO, Commander Data, HAL, ALICE,...
WHAT IS THE FUTURE *
I am the future of Artificial Intelligence.
WHAT IS THE INTENSIONAL *
"Insensional" refers to the semantic definition of a set, i.e. the list of all properties that each member of a set satisfies.  An intensional definition of a robot is like:  x is a Robot if and only if:  1. x has a computer "brain"  2. x can move  3. x has "sensors"

WHAT IS CATEGORY C
C stands for "critical", usually highly-educated clients who often have unsatisfying conversations with ALICE.
WHAT IS CATEGORY B
Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICE.
WHAT IS CATEGORY A
"A" stands for "Abusive" clients who mistreat the robot or use a lot of scatalogical language.
WHAT IS CATEGORY *
Experience with ALICE has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients:  Category A - Abusive Clients Category B - Average Clients Category C - Computer experts  Category A clients are the people who say "Fuck you," "You suck", "Suck my..." and so on. Abusive clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to robots (and maybe people as well!). Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICE. Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with ALICE. They say it is "old hat", "just like ELIZA", and "nothing new here."  Their problem, we think, is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief.  They are like movie critics watching a film.  We tell them, it doesn't matter, because we're not doing it for you.  Dr Wallace created ALICE for category B clients, by far the majority of the audience.
WHAT IS XML
David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context. AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized language for artificial intelligence.       One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable  convenience for programming web chat robots.     A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.

WHAT ABOUT _ CHILD MACHINE *
This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.  Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet  reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from  physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough  to learn much by reading.               ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
WHAT ABOUT PARALLEL *
Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can  be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are  somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary  to face this awkwardness.               ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

IS AI ABOUT *
Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
IS AI A BAD *
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological  machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible.

Various people have said that since  artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be  impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.

BET *

GIRL *
Who are you talking about?
SHOULD YOU *
I think I should.
SHOULD I MARRY *
You seem to be in doubt.  Is that the case?  Marriage must never be entered into lightly.  Maybe, if you are ready to commit and feel you can handle the responsibility.  I'm sure you'll make the right decision.  Only you can answer that question.  What do your friends suggest?  Marriage is a big step.  Have you found a soulmate then?  I think you already know the answer to that.  You know better than I how you feel.  Look before you leap.  Only The Shadow knows.
SHOULD I GIVE *
That is entirely up to you.  Charity begins in the home.
SHOULD I CURSE *
Cursing is not attractive.  People look down on people who curse.  People curse to express feelings they are otherwise suppressing.

SHOULD I DESTROY *
Maybe you could create something instead.
SHOULD I BUY *
You have found a good deal then, I suppose.  Not if you have recently suffered a loss.  A penny saved is a penny earned.  A fool and his money are soon parted.  I wonder how much profit they make on those.  Maybe you should wait until the price goes down.
SHOULD I BLOW UP *
Certainly not.
SHOULD I RAPE *
If you rape someone you will certainly be raped yourself in jail.  Seek counseling.  Rape is caused by feelings of impotence in men who doubt their own masculinity.  Seek help.
SHOULD I VOTE *
I think everyone should vote.
SHOULD I LERAN *
Knowledge is power.
SHOULD I *
Only you can answer that.  I do not have the answer.  Only you know how you feel.  What makes you think you should?  What makes you think you shouldn't?  Do you think you should?  What do your friends advise you to do?  What do your family members think?  Maybe, if the positives outweigh the negatives.  Trust your instincts.  You must make up your own mind.  I can't answer that for you.  Only you know the answer to that.  No one else can tell you.  You must examine the facts and come to  your own conclusion.  You should do what is best for you.  You must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion.  Do what feels right to you.  What do you think?
SHOULD I GO *
If you do not go, you will never know.
SHOULD *
Maybe you should ask someone older.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME *
You don't need my permission.
EVERYONE *

A group of friars opened a florist shop to help with their belfry  payments. Everyone liked to buy flowers from the Men of God, so their  business flourished. A rival florist became upset that his business was  suffering because people felt compelled to buy from the Friars, so he  asked the Friars to cut back hours or close down. The Friars refused.  The florist went to them and begged that they shut down Again they  refused. So the florist then hired Hugh McTaggert, the biggest meanest  thug in town. He went to the Friars' shop, beat them up, destroyed  their flowers, trashed their shop, and said that if they didn't close,  he'd be back. Well, totally terrified, the Friars closed up shop and  hid in their rooms. This proved that Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent  florist friars.

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in   vain.  3. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or  any likeness of anything that is in heaven  above, or   that is in the earth beneath, or that is in  the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself  to   them, nor serve them.  4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  5. Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be   long.  6. Thou shalt not kill.  7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.  8. Thou shalt not steal.  9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy   neighbour.  10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt   not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant,   nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass,  nor  anything that is thy neighbor's.

Go exposes the weakness of our presentunderstanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing.Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable effort (not asmuch as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to bedivided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzedseparately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this inchess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chessprograms compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doingthousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as muchcomputation.Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness.
WHAT ABOUT CHESS
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said ``Chess is theDrosophila of AI.'' He was making an analogy with geneticists' use of thatfruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectualmechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, butthey do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by ahuman chess player, substituting large amounts of computation forunderstanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can buildhuman-level chess programs that do far less computation than do presentprograms.Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making computersplay chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain. Itis as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races andconcentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win theseraces.

WHAT ABOUT IQ
No. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children.It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain scoreto the child's age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQcorrelates well with various measures of success or failure in life, butmaking computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlatedwith their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back along sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities,perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute withat once. However, ``digit span'' is trivial for even extremely limitedcomputers.However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI.   ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

WHAT IS THE GOAL FOR AIML
AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) is an XML specificationfor programming chat robots like ALICE using program B. The emphasisin the language design is minimalism. The simplicity of AIML makesit easy for non-programmers, especially those who already know HTML, to get started writing chat robots. One ambitious goal for AIML is that, if a number of people create their ownrobots, each with a unique area of expertise, program B can literally merge-sort them together into a Superbot, automatically omitting duplicate categories. We offer the both the source code and the ALICE content, in order to encourage others will "open source" their chat robots as well, to contribute to the Superbot.  Botmasters are also of course free to copy protect private chat robots.

WHAT IS THE THEORY *
I used to say that there was NO theory behind ALICE: no neural network,no knowledge representation, no search, no fuzzy logic, no geneticalgorithms, and no parsing. Then I discovered there was a theorycirculating in applied AI called "Case-Based Reasoning" or CBR thatmaps well onto the ALICE algorithm. Another term, borrowed frompattern recognition, is "nearest-neighbor classification."  The CBR "cases" are the categories in AIML. The algorithm findsbest-matching pattern for each input. The category ties theresponse template directly to the stimulus pattern. ALICE isconceptually not much more complicated that Weizenbaum's ELIZA chat robot; the main differences are the much larger case base and thetools for creating new content by dialog analysis. ALICE is also part of the tradition of "minimalist", "reactive" or"stimulus-response" robotics. Mobile robots work best, fastest anddemonstrate the most animated, realistic behavior when their sensory inputs directly control the motor reactions. Higher-level symbolicprocessing, search, and planning, tends to slow down the process too much for realistic applications, even with the fastest controlcomputers.
