# Alice-In-Text
My project to make a plain text dataset version of the files from Alice the chatbot.


# The Main Idea

The idea is to be able to use plain vanil text stored in a .txt file to store the
data for a bot so you don't need an AIML interpreter, and so you can make a bot
using the Alicebot data, but not be limited by the specifications of AIML.

A text file is easily edited and the goal is to only need regular expressions and/or
a fuzzy matcher to use the data in a bot.
