# Alice-In-Text
My project to make a plain text dataset version of the files from Alice the chatbot,
which stored it's data store in XML based AIML files

For more about Alice visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Linguistic_Internet_Computer_Entity.

# The Main Idea

The idea is to be able to use plain vanilla text stored in .txt files to store the
data for a bot so you don't need an AIML interpreter, and so you can make a bot
using the Alicebot data, but not be limited by the specifications of AIML.

A text file is easily edited and the goal is to only need regular expressions and/or
a fuzzy matcher to use the data in a bot.

The project is still in it's beginning stages and hasn't even reach alpha yet
Feel free to fork my project and do whatever you want with it
